### Interactive GIS with D3 and RShiny - Part I

----
#### Main Concepts

1. GIS Data Types (hint: remember the network data analogy--edges and nodes) 

  1. Vector: GIS data based on points, lines and polygons, used primarily for delineating map boundaries
  2. Raster: GIS data based on pixels (or cells), raster data constitues the attributes of each pertinent cell 

2. Shape Files: vector files for storing location and shape of a geographic feature 
3. 

#### GIS with RShiny, Intro

1. GIS data format
2. Importing maps
3. Geolocated social data

#### A GIS Visualization Exercise with R
