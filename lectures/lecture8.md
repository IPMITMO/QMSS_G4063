### Interactive GIS with D3 and RShiny - Part II

Continuing with GIS in R, and Primaries Twitter data

Last time we learned how to geolocate tweets on the U.S. map. This week I go through basic concepts of geoprocessing in "R" specifically, and at the end we conduct an exercise, counting the number of tweets (from each candidate) produced in each state. We will talk about the political import of such geo-frequencies.
